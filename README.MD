# JAVA EXERCISES

This is a set of four simple Java exercises. The project was created using Intellij IDEA and is organized in such a manner that it has a main file (Main.java) where it lists all questions and allows you to choose which you'd like to view the solution.
The questions are as follows:
1. Write a program to check whether a number is a cube or not.
2. Write a method to check whether a string is a valid password. Password rules:
    * Contain at least 10 characters.
    * Consist of only letters and digits.
    * Contain at least 2 digits.
3. Write a program to accept a float value of a number and return a rounded float value.
4. Write a program to check if a number is Armstrong or not. A number is Armstrong if the sum of the cubes of the digits of the number is equal to the number.
    Example: ```407 = (4*4*4) + (0*0*0) + (7*7*7)```
